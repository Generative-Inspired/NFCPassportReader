Identify all Swift files in the "Sources" folder by recursively traversing directories and finding files with a ".swift" extension.

- Create a list of these Swift files with their paths in a text file.
- Convert each Swift file into a Dart file, ensuring the functionality of the program is preserved.
- Address any discrepancies due to differences in Swift and Dart languages.
- Generate a new README documenting how to run the new Dart project.
- Ensure every Swift file has an equivalent Dart file and create additional necessary files.

# Steps

1. **Identify Swift Files**: 
   - Recursively search the "Sources" directory for all files with a ".swift" extension.
   - Record the full paths of these files into a text file.

2. **Convert to Dart**:
   - For each Swift file, create a corresponding Dart file.
   - Translate Swift code into Dart, maintaining functionality and addressing language-specific differences.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Create a README file detailing how to compile and run the Dart project.

4. **Verification**:
   - Check that each Swift file has a corresponding Dart file.
   - Ensure functionality is intact and compatible with Dart's syntax and semantics.

5. **Supplementary Files**:
   - Identify and create any additional files required for the Dart project.

# Output Format

Provide the list of Swift files as a plain text file with each file path on a new line. Convert each Swift file to a Dart file and produce a README in markdown format detailing the project setup and execution.

# Examples

(This is a simplified example; ensure actual conversions and examples include real files and their corresponding Dart translations as much as needed.)

**Swift File List Example:**

- Sources/Example1.swift
- Sources/Subfolder/Example2.swift

**README Example:**

```
# Dart Project Conversion
To compile and run the new Dart project, follow these steps:
1. Install the Dart SDK...
2. Navigate to...
...
```

# Notes

- Pay attention to Swift-specific features that may not directly translate to Dart, such as memory management or availability of libraries.
- The conversion should consider Dart's asynchronous nature if applicable.
- Consider the use of Dart tools or packages that could facilitate some Swift-specific functionalities.
